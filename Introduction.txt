Eyeplus is an app that allows users to detect text from images on their device thanks to the Firebase MLKit LIbrary and my application.

Users can select images either from their camera or their gallery. The image is then previewed to the user, who can then detect text from it.

Incase no text can be found, the app shows an alert that the image has no detectable text.

Comments and additions are highly appreciated.
